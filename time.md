Now we will deep dive into the history of women's representation in movies. We already learned a lot till we came here. Over all movies together, we can see that there are more male actors than female actresses. But, we do not know whether the number of female characters in movies changed or not. Are there any differences between the female protagonists and male ones? Is there any historical event that caused a significant change in women's representation? 

So, now we are starting to discover the answers of all these questions together. Are you ready?

Let's start by looking at changes in the number of female characters in movie summaries over the years. To do so, we have divided time into 10-year periods.

There is not a significant change in the female characters over decades. Female characters constitute only the 30-35% percentage of the protagonists represented in movie summaries. To be sure about our interpretation, we decided to shorten the interval of time within the period. Now, we will look at the data for 5-year periods.

As we can see, the number of female characters in summaries reached its peak at 62.96% in 1900-1905. When we dig into the factors impacting this increase according to the (https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/the-forgotten-female-action-stars-of-the-1910s/475635/)

"The proliferation of women in all areas of the film industry during the 1910s—not just as actors, but as screenwriters, theater managers, gossip columnists, film producers, and directors—reflected the increasing number of women in the American workplace, and also the efforts of the vocal and energetic women’s suffrage movement. "

Since we only checked the number of female characters in movie summaries, we are still wondering about the female protagonists. Now, we will look at the change of protagonists over the years. 
We extract the protagonist of the movie as the character which is mostly mentioned in the summary. 

First, let's look at all times and see whether females or males are mostly represented as the protagonists in movies.

Not so surprising.. the results are quite similar to the number of female/male character ratios that we showed in the Overview.

However, we want to know that was it always like that or changed over the years. Our question is "Did the percentage of movies starring female protagonists change over time?"
