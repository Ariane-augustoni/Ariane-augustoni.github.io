Now we will deep dive into the history of women's representation in movies. We already learned a lot till we came here. Over all movies together, we can see that there are more male actors than female actresses. But, we do not know whether the number of female characters in movies changed or not. Are there any differences between the female protagonists and male ones? Is there any historical event that caused a significant change in women's representation? 

So, now we are starting to discover the answers of all these questions together. Are you ready?

Let's start by looking at changes in the number of female characters in movie summaries over the years. To do so, we have divided time into 10-year periods. 

{% include Gender_character_count_10years.html %}

There is not a significant change in the female characters over decades. Female characters constitute only the 30-35% percentage of the protagonists represented in movie summaries. To be sure about our interpretation, we decided to shorten the interval of time within the period. Now, we will look at the data for 5-year periods.

{% include Gender_character_count_5years.html %}

As we can see, the number of female characters in summaries reached its peak at 62.96% in 1900-1905. When we searched this time period we learned that during the 1910s, women's increasing involvement in the film industry as actors, screenwriters, theater managers, film producers, and directors paralleled the increasing number of women in American workplaces and also vocal and energetic women's suffrage movement effort. The increase in the number of female chacaters in movie summary can be related to this historical movements.

Since we only checked the number of female characters in movie summaries, we are still curious about the female protagonists. Now, we will look at the change of protagonists over the years. 
We extract the protagonist of the movie as the character which is mostly mentioned in the summary. 

First, let's look at all times and see whether females or males are mostly represented as the protagonists in movies.

{% include Gender_proportion_protagonist.html %}

Not so surprising.. the results are quite similar to the number of female/male character ratios that we showed in the Overview.

However, we want to know whether it was always like that or changed over the years. Our next question is "Did the percentage of movies starring female protagonists change over time?"

{% include Gender_protagonist_count_10years.html %}

Now, we can see that female protagonists in movie summaries also have not evolved significantly over the years. There is a noticeable increase in female protagonists reaching the highest in 1920-1930 which may be the result of vocal and energetic women's suffrage movement effort that we mentioned previously in our character count analysis.

We have already learned a lot from the data. Movie summaries showed us that females' appearance in movies as both characters and protagonists has not changed significantly. Female characters and protagonists' appearance were always less than the males in movies.

Now that we know females are less involved than men in movies, we will ask the last part of our question: How have the adjectives representing women changed over time? To answer this question we will look at the change of adjectives that is used more for females than males.
