subtitle: Analysis of the words in the summaries of the movie dataset
---

Now that we have explored a bit the proportion of women in movies we were wondering how they were described and if the way they were described differed a lot between men and women. To do so we analysed the words of the movie summaries using machine learning on the movie summaries. Once the model was trained we were able to compare words that were more similar to women and others which were more similar to men.
