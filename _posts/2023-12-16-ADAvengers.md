Our project aims to critically examine the portrayal of female characters in cinema. Driven by the movies‘ profound cognitive influence, our objective is to explore how depictions of women evolve with time and to identify any existing biases or subtle forms of discrimination.

To achieve this, we will investigate the differences in commonly used adjectives that appear alongside male or female characters in movie summaries. We will also study the characteristics of female characters across different movie genres, tracing how their portrayals have transformed in line with the rising tide of the feminist movement.

This study is fueled by the increasing societal focus on gender representation in media. By scrutinizing historical and character-level data, we aim to reveal trends in the depiction of women in film, thereby mirroring broader societal shifts.
